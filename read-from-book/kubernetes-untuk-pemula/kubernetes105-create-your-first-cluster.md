Let's start again. Now we will do some practices.

In this part of the Kubernetes series, we will explore how to create a Kubernetes cluster in different environments. Whether you're running Kubernetes locally or in the cloud, understanding how to set up a cluster is fundamental to deploying and managing containerized applications efficiently.

We will cover three different ways to create a Kubernetes cluster:

- Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) - A lightweight way to run Kubernetes clusters locally for testing and development.

- K3D (K3S in Docker) - A more lightweight Kubernetes distribution, optimized for local development and CI/CD workflows.

- EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) - A managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS for running Kubernetes workloads in the cloud.

Each approach has its own use cases, advantages, and trade-offs. Let's dive into each one and see how to set up a cluster.

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster with Kind

![Kind Logo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x44sjqpd4v0ikbgpu2f.png)

Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) is one of the simplest ways to spin up a Kubernetes cluster for local development and testing. It runs Kubernetes clusters inside Docker containers and is widely used for CI/CD and development workflows.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine. ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))
- KIND CLI installed. ([installation guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation))
- Kubectl CLI installed. ([installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools))

### Create a Cluster with Kind

- Create a new Kind cluster:

```bash
$  kind create cluster --name kind-cluster

Creating cluster "kind-cluster" ...
 âœ“ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.31.0) ðŸ–¼
 âœ“ Preparing nodes ðŸ“¦
 âœ“ Writing configuration ðŸ“œ
 âœ“ Starting control-plane ðŸ•¹
 âœ“ Installing CNI ðŸ”Œ
 âœ“ Installing StorageClass ðŸ’¾
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind-cluster"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind-cluster

Thanks for using kind! ðŸ˜Š
```

- Check the cluster:

```bash
$   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind-cluster

Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:43417
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:43417/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

- List available nodes:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes

NAME                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
kind-cluster-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   75s   v1.31.0
```

### Create Simple Deployment

- Use the `kubectl` create deployment command to define and start a deployment:

```bash
$  kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

deployment.apps/nginx created
```

- Check deployment status using `kubectl get deployment` command:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment

NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx   0/1     1            0           29s
```

- Expose the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

service/nginx exposed
```

- Verify the Pod status and then try to access Nginx using your browser:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-676b6c5bbc-wd87x   1/1     Running   0          12m
```

![Access Nginx](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xtltv33114mzja34rr1g.png)

- Delete the cluster when no longer needed

```bash
$  kind delete cluster --name kind-cluster

Deleting cluster "kind-cluster" ...
Deleted nodes: ["kind-cluster-control-plane"]
```

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster with K3D

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS EKS

![AWS EKS Logo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8stn3qycpy7381a03rj4.png)

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service on AWS, designed for running production workloads.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured. ([installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
- EKSCTL CLI installed. ([installation guide](https://eksctl.io/installation))
- Kubectl CLI installed. ([installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools))

### Create a cluster on EKS

To create a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, you can use the AWS Console (dashboard) or the eksctl CLI. For this guide, we will use `eksctl`.

We will provisions an EKS cluster with two `t4g.small` nodes in the `us-east-1` region, making it ready for running Kubernetes workloads.

```bash
$ eksctl create cluster  \
--name cluster-1  \
--region us-east-1 \
--node-type t4g.small \
--nodes 2 \
--nodegroup-name node-group-1

2025-02-01 19:52:35 [â„¹]  eksctl version 0.202.0
2025-02-01 19:52:35 [â„¹]  using region us-east-1
2025-02-01 19:52:37 [â„¹]  setting availability zones to [us-east-1c us-east-1f]

...

2025-02-01 20:02:04 [â„¹]  creating addon
2025-02-01 20:02:04 [â„¹]  successfully created addon
2025-02-01 20:02:05 [â„¹]  creating addon
2025-02-01 20:02:06 [â„¹]  successfully created addon
2025-02-01 20:02:07 [â„¹]  creating addon
2025-02-01 20:02:07 [â„¹]  successfully created addon
"us-east-1" region is ready
```

- Access AWS console, navigate to the EKS service and you can see the cluster is successfully created.

![After cluster creation](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u6fea9eyql10rn2kvp9f.png)

- List available nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
NAME                             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-192-168-xx-yy.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   17m   v1.30.8-eks-aeac579
ip-192-168-xx-yy.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   17m   v1.30.8-eks-aeac57
```

### Create Simple Deployment

- Use the kubectl create deployment command to define and start a deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

deployment.apps/nginx create
```

- Check deployment status using `kubectl get deployment` command:

```bash
$  kubectl get deployment

NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx    1/1     1            1           23s
```

- Verify the Pod status:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                     READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-bf5d5cf98-9dld5    1/1     Running        0          43s
```

- Expose the service:

```bash
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --name=nginx-service
```

- Try to access using the browser:

![Access the service](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s3c2ul7c18ntg8x5tq4r.png)

- Delete the cluster when no longer needed:

```bash
$  eksctl delete cluster --name cluster-1 --region us-east-1

2025-02-01 20:51:59 [â„¹]  deleting EKS cluster "cluster-1"
2025-02-01 20:52:02 [â„¹]  will drain 0 unmanaged nodegroup(s) in cluster "cluster-1"

2025-02-01 21:02:04 [âœ”]  all cluster resources were deleted
```

Conclusion

Setting up a Kubernetes cluster is the first step in running containerized applications at scale. In this guide, we've explored three different ways to create a Kubernetes cluster and do a simple deployment: using Kind and K3D for local development and using EKS for cloud-based deployments. Each method has its own advantages depending on your use case.

Stay tuned!
